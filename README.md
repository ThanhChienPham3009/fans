# This is eProject Group 1 - Fanimation
A fan is an electronic device designed to move air, providing ventilation or cooling. It plays an important role in various environments, from homes and offices to industrial settings. The fan uses a motor to rotate blades attached to a central shaft. As the blades spin, they create a pressure difference in the air, causing the air to move from high-pressure areas (behind the blades) to low-pressure areas (in front of the blades), generating airflow. Fans are highly versatile, easy to find, and an essential part of everyday life, especially in hot or stuffy environments.
